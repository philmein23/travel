### uTravel - Making your trips easier to enjoy

####Ever experience that moment at the ending of a trip where you wish you had gone to the one place or should have eaten at the one famous restaurant? uTravel takes away the pain of having to plan every last stop to make a memorable traveling experience. For the first time be treated like a true visitor and let us make your trip exciting again. No more hustling for crowded parking or debating on which restaurant or park you want to visit. uTravel will grow on you and offer suggested itinerary based on YOUR likes and interests. Even offering a chauffeur service. It's time to focus on having the fun you had planned from the beginning without the stress attached. 

###### This is the beginning of what will start as a month long hack-a-thon but we hope to develop further.
